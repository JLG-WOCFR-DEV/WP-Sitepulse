Monitors your WordPress site's speed, database, maintenance, server, and errors with modular, toggleable tools.

== Description ==

Sitepulse - JLG takes the pulse of your WordPress site, offering modules for:

* Speed analysis (load times, server processing time)
* Database optimization (clean bloat, suggest indexes)
* Server monitoring (CPU, memory, uptime) with programmable maintenance windows that pause alerts and log ignored checks
* Error logging and alerts
* Plugin impact analysis
* Maintenance checks and AI insights
* Adjustable AI insight generation frequency with built-in rate limiting
* Custom dashboards and multisite support
* Custom thresholds for speed alerts, uptime targets, and revision cleanup notices

Toggle modules in the admin panel to keep it lightweight. Includes debug mode and cleanup options.

== Site Health diagnostics ==

SitePulse registers additional checks within the WordPress "Site Health" tool:

* **SitePulse status** summarises WP-Cron warnings and critical AI Insight errors, raising the severity when alerts are pending.
* **SitePulse Gemini API key** warns administrators when the AI module is active without a configured Gemini API key.

These checks surface potential cron failures or missing credentials directly inside the core diagnostics dashboard.

== Installation ==

1.  Upload `sitepulse-jlg.zip` to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2.  Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3.  Visit 'SitePulse' in your admin menu to configure the modules.

== Changelog ==

* Initial release with all core modules.
* Removed the call to `flush_rewrite_rules()` on activation to avoid an unnecessary and costly permalink flush.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.0 =
* First versionâ€”full pulse-monitoring suite!
